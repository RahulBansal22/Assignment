## Project Description: Employee Timesheet Analyzer

### Overview:

The Employee Timesheet Analyzer is a Python project designed to programmatically analyze employee timesheets stored in Excel format. The script reads an Excel file containing time and attendance data and extracts information about employee work patterns based on specific criteria.

### Technology Stack:

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas Library:** Utilized for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for reading and processing Excel files.
- **Openpyxl Library:** Employed for Excel file support, specifically to handle reading Excel files without relying on external dependencies.

### Project Workflow:

1. **Reading Excel File:**
   - The script reads the employee timesheet data from an Excel file using the Pandas library.
   - 'openpyxl' engine is specified for compatibility and reading Excel files.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - The project analyzes the timesheet data based on specific criteria:
     - Identifying employees who have worked for 7 consecutive days.
     - Detecting employees with less than 10 hours of time between shifts (greater than 1 hour).
     - Identifying employees who have worked for more than 14 hours in a single shift.

3. **Dependencies:**
   - **Pandas:** Handles data manipulation and analysis. Install using `pip install pandas`.
   - **Openpyxl:** Supports Excel file operations. Install using `pip install openpyxl`.

### Common Errors and Resolutions:

- **Missing 'xlrd' Library:**
  - In some environments, the 'xlrd' library is required for reading Excel files using Pandas.
  - Resolve by installing 'xlrd' using `pip install xlrd`.

- **Excel File Format Determination Error:**
  - Pandas may encounter issues determining the Excel file format automatically.
  - Manually specify the 'openpyxl' engine to resolve: `pd.read_excel(file_path, engine='openpyxl')`.

### Usage Instructions:

1. **Setting up the Project:**
   - Clone the Git repository and navigate to the project directory.
   - Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.

2. **Running the Script:**
   - Specify the Excel file name in the script (`file_path = 'your_timesheet.xlsx'`).
   - Run the script, and it will analyze the timesheet data based on specified criteria.

3. **Git Repository and Output File:**
   - Initialize a Git repository, commit the code, and push it to a hosting platform.
   - 'output.txt' is generated with the console output and committed to the repository.

### Notes:

- This project is designed to be flexible and can be adapted for various timesheet formats.
- Ensure to replace placeholder file names in the script with your actual file names.
- Follow provided instructions for Git repository setup and pushing code and 'output.txt'.
